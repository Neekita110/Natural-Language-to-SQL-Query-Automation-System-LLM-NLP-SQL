# Natural-Language-to-SQL-Query-Automation-System-LLM-NLP-SQL


## Overview
This project implements an automated system to convert natural language (NL) instructions into SQL queries. Leveraging advanced NLP techniques, a large language model (LLM) pipeline, and TensorFlow, this system achieves 90%+ accuracy in generating SQL queries. It also provides an automated execution environment using SQLite, enabling immediate query results from natural language inputs.

## Features
- Natural Language to SQL Translation: Uses GeminiPro and NLP models with TensorFlow to interpret NL inputs and generate SQL queries with high accuracy.
- Automated SQL Execution: Executes generated SQL queries directly using SQLite, allowing seamless integration with Python.
- Data Handling: Utilizes Pandas for data manipulation and result handling, making it suitable for large datasets and complex queries.

## Technical Stack
- Languages: Python, SQL
- Libraries: TensorFlow, SQLite, Pandas
- Models: Large Language Models (LLMs), NLP Pipeline
- Tools: GeminiPro

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy rate of over 90% in natural language to SQL conversion.
- Demonstrated effective SQL execution automation in Python.
